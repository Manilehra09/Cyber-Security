# Offensive Security Overview

Offensive security is a proactive approach to cybersecurity focused on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Unlike defensive security, which aims to protect and monitor systems, offensive security seeks to simulate real-world attacks to assess an organization's resilience.

Key aspects of offensive security include:

- **Penetration Testing:** Systematic evaluation of systems, networks, and applications to uncover security weaknesses.
- **Red Teaming:** Simulating sophisticated adversaries to test detection and response capabilities.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation.
- **Social Engineering:** Manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access or information.
- **Physical Security Testing:** Assessing physical controls such as locks, access badges, and surveillance.

Offensive security professionals use a combination of manual techniques and automated tools to mimic the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real attackers. The insights gained from offensive security engagements help organizations strengthen their defenses, improve incident response, and reduce overall risk.

## Red Teams

Red teams are specialized groups within offensive security that emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of real-world adversaries. Their objective is to challenge an organization's security controls by conducting realistic attack scenarios, often without prior notice to defenders. This approach helps organizations evaluate their detection, response, and recovery capabilities under pressure.

Red team engagements typically involve:

- **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about targets to identify potential attack vectors.
- **Initial Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain entry into systems or networks.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Increasing access rights to move deeper within the environment.
- **Lateral Movement:** Navigating across systems to access critical assets.
- **Exfiltration:** Simulating data theft or other malicious objectives.

The findings from red team exercises provide valuable insights for improving security controls, incident response plans, and overall organizational resilience.
