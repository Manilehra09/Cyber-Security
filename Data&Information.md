# Data and Information

**Data** refers to raw, unprocessed facts, figures, or symbols. It can be numbers, text, images, or sounds that by themselves may not have meaning.

**Information** is processed, organized, or structured data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making or understanding.

**Example:**
- Data: `42, "apple", 98.6`
- Information: `"The temperature is 98.6Â°F."`



## Data Security and Information Security

**Data Security** involves protecting raw data from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft. It focuses on safeguarding data at rest, in transit, and during processing using methods like encryption, access controls, and backups.

**Information Security** is a broader concept that protects both data and the systems that process, store, and transmit information. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, addressing risks such as cyberattacks, insider threats, and accidental loss.
