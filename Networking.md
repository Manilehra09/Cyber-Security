# Networking in Cyber Security

## Overview
Networking is a foundational aspect of cyber security, enabling communication between devices and systems while presenting unique security challenges.

## Key Concepts

- **Network Protocols:** TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH
- **Network Devices:** Routers, switches, firewalls, IDS/IPS, proxies
- **Network Topologies:** Star, mesh, bus, ring

## Security Measures

- **Firewalls:** Control incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** Encrypt data transmitted over public networks.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate sensitive systems to reduce attack surface.

## Common Threats

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**
- **Packet Sniffing**
- **Spoofing and Phishing**

## Best Practices

- Regularly update and patch network devices.
- Use strong authentication and encryption.
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies.
- Implement least privilege access controls.

## Useful Tools

- **Wireshark:** Network protocol analyzer
- **Nmap:** Network scanner
- **Snort:** IDS/IPS
- **OpenVPN:** VPN solution
