# What is Computer Networking?

**Computer networking** is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices (such as computers, servers, and network devices) to share resources, exchange data, and communicate with each other. Networks can be as small as two computers connected in a home or as large as millions of devices connected across the globe (the Internet).

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes:** Devices connected to the network (e.g., computers, printers, routers).
- **Network Types:** 
    - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small area, like a home or office.
    - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large geographic areas, like cities or countries.
- **Protocols:** Rules that define how data is transmitted (e.g., TCP/IP).
- **Topology:** The physical or logical arrangement of network devices (e.g., star, bus, ring).

## Common Uses

- File and resource sharing
- Internet access
- Communication (email, messaging, VoIP)
- Centralized data management

Computer networking is fundamental to modern computing and enables most digital communication and collaboration.



## What is a Network?

A **network** is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources with each other. These devices, or nodes, use communication protocols to exchange data over wired or wireless connections.

## What is the Internet?

The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computer networks. It uses standardized communication protocols (such as TCP/IP) to link billions of devices worldwide, enabling access to information, communication, and a wide range of online services.
