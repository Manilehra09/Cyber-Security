# Network Devices

Network devices are hardware components used to connect computers and other electronic devices together, enabling communication and data exchange within a network. Common network devices include:

- **Network Interface Card (NIC):** Enables a device to connect to a network by providing the hardware interface for wired or wireless communication.
- **Bus:** A network topology where all devices are connected to a single communication line (the bus). 
- **Router:** Directs data packets between networks and manages traffic.
- **Switch:** Connects devices within a local network and forwards data based on MAC addresses.
- **Hub:** Broadcasts data to all devices in a network segment (less common today).
- **Access Point:** Provides wireless connectivity to devices within a network.
- **Modem:** Converts digital data to analog signals and vice versa for internet access.
- **Firewall:** Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic for security.

These devices work together to create efficient, secure, and scalable networks.
