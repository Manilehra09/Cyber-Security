## Defensive Security Teams

Defensive security teams, commonly known as **blue teams**, are responsible for protecting an organization's systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. They focus on detecting, preventing, and responding to security incidents by implementing robust security controls and monitoring activities.

Typical roles in defensive security teams include:

- **Security Analysts:** Monitor systems for suspicious activity and investigate potential threats.
- **Incident Responders:** Manage and mitigate security breaches and coordinate recovery efforts.
- **Threat Hunters:** Proactively search for hidden threats within the environment.
- **Security Engineers:** Design and implement security solutions and infrastructure.
- **SOC (Security Operations Center) Staff:** Oversee real-time monitoring and response operations.

Defensive teams collaborate with offensive teams to identify vulnerabilities and improve security measures, ensuring comprehensive protection against evolving cyber threats.

# Defensive Security and Black Team

## Defensive Security
Defensive security focuses on protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. Key activities include:

- Implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Regular vulnerability assessments and patch management
- Security awareness training for staff
- Incident response planning and execution

## Black Team
A Black Team simulates real-world adversaries to test an organization's defenses. Their objectives include:

- Identifying weaknesses in security controls
- Conducting penetration testing and red teaming exercises
- Providing feedback to improve defensive measures

### Work of a Black Teamer

Black teamers operate covertly to emulate advanced threat actors. Their work involves:

- Planning and executing stealth attacks to bypass security controls
- Using social engineering and technical exploits to gain access
- Documenting findings and attack paths
- Collaborating with defenders to strengthen organizational security
- Continuously updating tactics to reflect evolving threats
