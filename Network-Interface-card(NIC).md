# Network Interface Card (NIC)

A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. It enables communication between devices over local area networks (LAN) or the internet by converting data into signals that can be transmitted and received.

## Example

For instance, a desktop computer may have an Ethernet NIC to connect to a wired network, or a Wi-Fi NIC for wireless connectivity.


## Types of NIC Cards

Network Interface Cards can be categorized based on their connection type and functionality:

### 1. Ethernet NIC
- **Description:** Used for wired network connections via Ethernet cables (RJ-45).
- **Features:** Reliable, high-speed data transfer, commonly found in desktops and servers.

### 2. Wireless NIC (Wi-Fi NIC)
- **Description:** Enables wireless connectivity using Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11).
- **Features:** Used in laptops, smartphones, and tablets for mobility and convenience.

### 3. Fiber Optic NIC
- **Description:** Connects to fiber optic networks using optical cables.
- **Features:** Supports very high-speed data transfer, used in enterprise and data center environments.

### 4. USB NIC
- **Description:** External NICs that connect via USB ports.
- **Features:** Portable and easy to install, useful for devices without built-in NICs.

### 5. Token Ring NIC
- **Description:** Used for Token Ring network topology (now largely obsolete).
- **Features:** Provided connectivity in legacy IBM networks.

### 6. Virtual NIC
- **Description:** Software-based NICs used in virtual machines.
- **Features:** Allows VMs to communicate over physical or virtual networks.

Each type of NIC is designed for specific networking needs and environments.
