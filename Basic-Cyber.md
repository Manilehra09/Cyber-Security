# What is Cyber Security?

**Cyber security** refers to the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. It involves technologies, processes, and controls designed to safeguard information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

## Key Aspects of Cyber Security

- **Network Security:** Protects network infrastructure from intrusions and attacks.
- **Application Security:** Ensures software is free from vulnerabilities.
- **Information Security:** Safeguards data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- **Operational Security:** Manages and protects data assets and processes.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Plans for restoring systems after a cyber incident.

## Importance

Cyber security is essential for individuals and organizations to prevent data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage caused by cyber threats such as malware, phishing, and ransomware.

## Types of Hacking

- **White Hat Hacking:** Ethical hackers who test systems for vulnerabilities to help organizations improve security.
- **Black Hat Hacking:** Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain or to cause harm.
- **Grey Hat Hacking:** Hackers who may violate laws or ethical standards but do not have malicious intent.
- **Script Kiddies:** Individuals who use existing tools and scripts to hack without deep technical knowledge.
- **Hacktivism:** Hacking conducted to promote political or social agendas.
- **State-Sponsored Hacking:** Cyber attacks carried out by government agencies for espionage or disruption.

## Offensive vs Defensive Security

- **Offensive Security:** Focuses on proactively identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. Techniques include penetration testing, red teaming, and ethical hacking to simulate real-world attacks and uncover weaknesses before malicious actors do.
- **Defensive Security:** Involves protecting systems and data from cyber threats by implementing security controls, monitoring, incident response, and patch management. Blue teams work to detect, prevent, and mitigate attacks to ensure ongoing protection.
